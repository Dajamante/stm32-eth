## Unreleased
* General
    * Remove the `smi` feature and always enable miim/smi. Use `ieee802_3_miim` for SMI access
    * Split MAC and DMA setup into their own separate modules
* CI
    * Test compilability of examples more extensively
* Examples:
    * Switch to `defmt` as logger
    * Use `probe-run` as runner
    * Ensure that all examples build (and hopefully run) for all supported MCUs
    * Add more extensive example run and build docs
    * Remove arp-smoltcp example
    * Add `rtic-echo` example
    * Use a more simple `memory.x` that works for all supported MCUs
